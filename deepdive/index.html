ALITO DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT 'QUICKENED' IS, AND IT'S AMAZING HOW HE COULD FIND THESE OPINIONS TO USE IT WHILE NOT KNOWING WHY THAT WORD MIGHT APPEAR THERE. EDIT: IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME HE DOES DEFINE IT.

FUN FACT; ABORTION IS NOT NEW BUT THE PUSH TO MAKE IT FULLY ILLEGAL IS. THROUGH EARLIER AGES LAWS AGAINST ABORTION WERE OFTEN SPOTTY, UNENFORCED, OR IGNORED. YOU'LL FIND PLENTY OF LETTERS AND WRITINGS DISCUSSING IT AND THEY'RE NOT ALL ANTI-ABORTION DESPITE THE TIMES. PEOPLE THEN WERE FAR MORE NUANCED THAN YOU'D THINK. A LOT OF THEM LEFT THE ENTIRE QUESTION UP TO WOMEN, OR WOMEN SIMPLY KEPT THE MATTER ENTIRELY TO THEMSELVES.

YOU WILL SEE THE WORD 'QUICK' OR 'QUICKENED' SOMETIMES. THIS REFERS TO WHEN A BABY STARTS MOVING IN THE WOMB. SOME SOCIETIES EVEN THOUGHT THIS WAS THE MOMENT THE SOUL ENTERED THE BODY (I.E. YOU WEREN'T BORN WITH IT). ALITO CITES THESE SECTIONS AS THOUGH THEY MAKE ABORTION A CRIME, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY. THEY SAY THAT ABORTING A CHILD AFTER IT HAS QUICKENED IS A CRIME. I.E. WHAT MIGHT NOW BE CALLED A LATE-STAGE ABORTION.

IF YOU'RE GOING TO CITE JURISTS FROM 400 YEARS AGO, AT LEAST DO US THE DECENCY OF CITING THEM CORRECTLY. THEN EXPLAIN WHY THE FUCK WE SHOULD CARE WHAT THIS ENGLISH BLOKE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER. WHAT HAPPENED TO TEXTUALISM? I THOUGH CONSERVATIVES WERE HIGH ON THAT NOTION. IS ALITO SO SHORT ON A TEXTUAL BASIS HE HAS TO REACH ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MAGNA CARTA?</p> <br></br>

THESE IDEAS WERE PRECEDENT FOR 300 YEARS, UNTIL THE 1970S.
